# SpringBoot_MongoDB_RestAPI

Simple Spring Boot Application (2.3.4) with Java 8 , using the Spring Initialzr. I used Spring Data MongoDB and extended the MongoRepository for getting automatically the CRUD query methods.
Also an extra configuration script was added for removing the "_class" field that have been creating during posting.
All the endpoints were tested with POSTMAN.
